# Raven-Storm Toolkit

**Cerberus is a powerful DDoS toolkit for penetration tests, including attacks for several protocols written in python(2).**

Takedown WiFi access points, devices in your network, servers, services, and Bluetooth devices with ease.

Cerberus(abbreviation) is desinged to help you to **test, understand, and learn from stress-testing** attacks.

Cerberus can **deal with strong servers** and **can be optimized** for non typical targets.

Raven will fit your purpose, even if it is **jamming down wifi networks or bluetooth devices**.

_I archived this repository because I currently do not want to work on it._
